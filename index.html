  <h1>Hello, my name is Valerie</h1>
  <p>A few things about me:</p>I
  <ul>
    <li>My previous job was as an Admin Assistant at Page One Power</li>
    <li>I have done a little bit of html/css coding, mostly at a previous job</li>
    <li>Years ago, my degree was in Computer Information Systems, but I never did much with it.</li>
    <li>I want a career, not a boring job</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Week 2 - August 16</h2>
  <p>I have a feeling this week will be pretty typical of the whole course. At the beginning of the week I felt like I
    was the dumbest kid in class. Luckily, things started to make sense. </p>
  <p>I have to find more time at home to practice. That seems to be my biggest challenge. </p>
  <p>I feel like I am struggling with my logic process. I don't always find the best way to solve a problem. I need to
    practice the pseudo code so that I can work through the problem before trying to code. </p>
  <p>At the Fireside on Thursday, I actually felt like everything was making sense. I could contribute to the
    building process, unlike the Farm build earlier in the day. I need to remember the feeling of confidence. </p>
  <p>I am looking forward to learning more javascript. I like it! I also am looking forward to working more with HTML
    and CSS to get the practice.</p>

  <h2>Week 3 - August 24</h2>
  <p>I struggled with the coding of the MVC this week. I think it had a lot to do with the problems with my computer. No
    practice at night because I was repairing then replacing my hard drive. The logic behind it all made sense. I
    struggled with following the different names from each part. I do feel like I am behind a little on terminology...I
    like
    to have precise definitions for things and I can't say that I have learned them for some pieces. </p>
  <p>I was able to get in practice today and it all made much more sense. That is my victory for the week. I don't like
    feeling behind/lost so that is a good reminder that if I can practice during the week, I will stay caught up. </p>
  <p>I am looking forward to our new topic for week 4</p>

  <h2>Week 4 - August 30</h2>
  <p>Wow! One third of the class done. Crazy. Go me! I made it this far. </p>
  <p>The observer pattern is exciting. It feels like we are really getting into development now. We are interacting
    with databases. However, it definitely adds complexity and an additional level of difficulty. Katherine was a big
    help in my tutoring session. She definitely clarified a few concepts I was struggling with. I am sure that after
    working on the project, it will all be much clearer for me. My improvement goal for next week is to get even more
    practice during the week so that I am not needing the project at the end of the week to cement the ideas in my head.
    It will just be a confirmation that I did understand everything. Oh, and my second goal is to just get out of my own
    way. I swear, sometimes I am my biggest problem.</p>
  <p>My win for the week was the whiteboard challenge on Thursday. I felt pretty comfortable with it, even though I did
    goof it a little,I caught my mistake. It felt good to be able to do the code in front of an audience. </p>
  <p>I am looking forward to building servers and learning a framework. More power at my fingertips!! If I can just get
    the syntax correct. </p>
