  <h1>Hello, my name is Valerie</h1>
  <p>A few things about me:</p>I
  <ul>
    <li>My previous job was as an Admin Assistant at Page One Power</li>
    <li>I have done a little bit of html/css coding, mostly at a previous job</li>
    <li>Years ago, my degree was in Computer Information Systems, but I never did much with it.</li>
    <li>I want a career, not a boring job</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Week 2 - August 16</h2>
  <p>I have a feeling this week will be pretty typical of the whole course. At the beginning of the week I felt like I
    was the dumbest kid in class. Luckily, things started to make sense. </p>
  <p>I have to find more time at home to practice. That seems to be my biggest challenge. </p>
  <p>I feel like I am struggling with my logic process. I don't always find the best way to solve a problem. I need to
    practice the pseudo code so that I can work through the problem before trying to code. </p>
  <p>At the Fireside on Thursday, I actually felt like everything was making sense. I could contribute to the
    building process, unlike the Farm build earlier in the day. I need to remember the feeling of confidence. </p>
  <p>I am looking forward to learning more javascript. I like it! I also am looking forward to working more with HTML
    and CSS to get the practice.</p>
